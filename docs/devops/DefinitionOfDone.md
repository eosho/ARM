# Definition of Done

> Each Scrum Team has its own Definition of Done or consistent acceptance criteria across all User Stories.  A Definition of Done drives the quality of work and is used to assess when a User Story has been completed.
> -- <cite>[ScrumInc][1]</cite>

For Alcatraz the list is specified below. As a principle any non-functional/horizontal aspect that is supported should still be supported before a story is done. The list below should not be static and the team can change it as a part of the retrospective

* Acceptance criteria is met
* Code review by peer(s) and **NOT** committer
* Code is running in pre-production successfully
* User documentation is updated
* Code has sufficient monitoring/alerting
* Code is reasonably covered by unit/functional tests
* Automated tests for the story are created and passed
* All regression testing of the product is moving
* System-level non-functional requirements are tested and passed
* Technical documentation updated

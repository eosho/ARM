# Team Cultural Manifesto

Development Methodology

| Number | Rules |
|--------|-------|
| 1 | We are a team. When an individual is facing problem he will report it right away, so that his team members are informed and can help him. |
| 2 | Agile and Scrum are for quickly delivering quality, the logic behind the methodology (transparency) is more important than the process |
| 3 | Scrum stand-ups are important, but we should be interacting throughout the day. |
| 4 | Estimates are good if theyâ€™re useful, preferably using story points |
| 5 | Pair programming rocks. Team should be pairing at all times. |
| 6 | We push our code, configurations or documents before end of day everyday to DevOps |
| 7 | We are a Scrum development team. Meaning every team member produces business value |

## Development Team

The members of the development team will work scrum and agile, so that they can incrementally engineer end to end automation. Team members actions will be tracked with Azure DevOps, so that learning impediments are quickly detected and the team velocity becomes transparent. Due to the technical nature of the development team a specific engineering skill set is required:

| Number |   Rules |
|--------|---------|
| Scripting knowledge to automated processes | (PowerShell Core, ARM Templates/Bicep, .NET) |
| Version Control knowledge | (Azure DevOps, Git) |
| Cloud knowledge | (Azure LogAnalytics, FaaS, DevOps) |
| Agile / Scrum knowledge | To maintain objective and data driven insight into the team velocity: (Azure DevOps, Azure Monitor, LogAnalytics) |
| Automated testing | To maintain a secure and compliant cloud platform: (Security, Regression, Unit and Performance testing) |

# Definition of Ready

## How to define a User Story:

1. Story must be written as a **User Story** the story description will have the following structure

        "As a <kind of user> I want <feature>, so that <benefit>"

2. Acceptance criteria **must** exist and be understood by team.

3. Story has been estimated by **The Team.**

4. The team understands how to demo the feature.

5. Stories are put in Azure DevOps and on the **SCRUM** board.

6. Every Story should **Produce a clear deliverable.**

7. A user story build implements the **INVEST** Model.

| **Letter** | **Meaning** | **Description**
|------------|-------------|----------------
| **I** | [Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_%28mnemonic%29#Independent) | The PBI should be self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another PBI.
| **N** | [Negotiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_%28mnemonic%29#Negotiable) | PBIs are not explicit contracts and should leave space for discussion.
| **V** | [Valuable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_%28mnemonic%29#Valuable) | A PBI must deliver value to the stakeholders.
| **E** | [Estimable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_%28mnemonic%29#Estimable) | You must always be able to estimate the size of a PBI.
| **S** | [Small](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_%28mnemonic%29#Small) | PBIs should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize with a certain level of accuracy.
| **T** | [Testable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_%28mnemonic%29#Testable) | The PBI or its related description must provide the necessary information to make test development possible.
